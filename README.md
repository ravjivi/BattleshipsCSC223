PROJECT TITLE: Battleship
Date: 23/07
AUTHOR: Viraaj Ravji
Purpose: CSC233 assesment

This project is created for the purpose of a computer science assesment
The game was entirely created by myself. All the code and assets are created by myself
The game is inspired by Battleship, using the rules and names of ships from the 1990 version. However, has been adapted by myself for the purpose of a single player game in java by adding an AI.
Hopefully you enjoy!
